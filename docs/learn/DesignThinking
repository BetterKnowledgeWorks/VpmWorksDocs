# Design Thinking: The 5 Classic Steps

> Design Thinking is a human-centered, iterative approach to problem-solving developed and popularized by organizations like IDEO and the Stanford d.school.

## 1. Empathize

- Understand your users and their needs through observation, interaction, and immersion.  
- Engage directly with users to uncover not just what they do, but **why** they do it.  
- Methods include interviews, shadowing, and empathy mapping.  
- The goal is to **set aside assumptions** and gain real insight into their experiences.  
- Builds emotional understanding and creates a foundation for meaningful design.  
- Use open-ended questions and let users tell stories about their pain points.  
- Pay attention to body language, tone, and environment—it all matters.  
- Document raw observations before drawing conclusions.

## 2. Define

- Synthesize your findings from the Empathize stage into a **clear problem statement**.  
- Frame the challenge in human-centered terms: “How might we help [user] achieve [goal]?”  
- Narrow down the most important user needs uncovered earlier.  
- Avoid jumping to solutions—focus on defining the **real underlying problem**.  
- Combine user insights with design constraints to focus your scope.  
- This step guides the rest of the process by aligning the team around a shared objective.  
- Reframe problems creatively to open new solution spaces.  
- Use tools like affinity diagrams, personas, and problem framing matrices.

## 3. Ideate

- Generate a wide range of ideas—**quantity over quality** at this stage.  
- Encourage **wild, divergent thinking** to break past obvious solutions.  
- Use methods like brainstorming, SCAMPER, and mind mapping.  
- Build on each other’s ideas and avoid immediate criticism or evaluation.  
- The goal is to explore **many paths**, not to find the final answer yet.  
- Consider analogies from other industries or nature to inspire new thinking.  
- Later, converge by grouping, ranking, or combining ideas for testing.  
- Use “Yes, and…” rather than “No, but…” to keep momentum going.

## 4. Prototype

- Create low-fidelity, inexpensive representations of ideas quickly.  
- These can be sketches, storyboards, paper interfaces, or basic physical models.  
- The purpose is not perfection—just enough to **test a concept**.  
- Show your ideas, don’t just describe them—make them tangible.  
- Start small and evolve based on what you learn.  
- Prototypes allow you to uncover usability issues early.  
- Keep iterations quick so failure is fast and cheap.  
- Involve users in co-creating or reacting to prototypes.

## 5. Test

- Present your prototypes to real users for feedback.  
- Watch what people **do**, not just what they **say**.  
- Ask follow-up questions to dig into reactions and confusion.  
- Capture emotional responses, pain points, and surprises.  
- Use feedback to refine both the prototype and your understanding of the problem.  
- Testing often loops you back to earlier stages—**that’s expected**.  
- Avoid defending your prototype—you’re testing ideas, not validating your ego.  
- Iteration is key: test, refine, repeat.
