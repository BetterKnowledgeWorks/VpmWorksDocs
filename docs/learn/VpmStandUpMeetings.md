# VPM Stand-Up Meetings
VPM stand-up meetings are short, focused sessions designed to maintain momentum, surface issues early, and keep teams aligned. Like Agile daily stand-ups, they’re fast-paced (usually 15 minutes or less), happen at a regular time, and are intended to be lightweight. The key difference lies in the visual context—VPM stand-ups happen in front of a shared project visualization, such as a wallboard, whiteboard, or digital canvas that reflects current project status.

The structure is simple: each participant gives a brief update tied to the visual workspace—what’s moving, what’s blocked, and what’s new. The goal isn’t detailed discussion or problem-solving; it’s awareness, accountability, and fast feedback. Like a sailing crew checking conditions and adjusting course, these stand-ups help teams navigate ordinary changes—shifting priorities, new requests, emerging risks—without losing sight of the bigger destination. Issues identified during the stand-up are captured visually and followed up outside the meeting, keeping the session focused and the team agile in the face of everyday unpredictability.

To be effective, VPM stand-ups must be sharp and fast-paced—almost like a well-drilled crew shift change. The goal is to move through the entire project landscape in 15 minutes, not to solve problems in real time. Discipline matters: once these meetings start to bloat with side conversations or deep dives, momentum fades. People stop seeing the value, start finding reasons to skip, and soon the meetings lack the quorum needed to make real-time decisions or surface cross-team dependencies. Brevity isn't just a courtesy—it’s what keeps the stand-up alive and useful.

## Choosing the VPM Stand-Up Team

## Varying Attendence and Freqency
Stand-up frequency in VPM should flex with the project’s pace and pressure. Two or three times per week is often enough during steady progress, but when the project hits a rough patch—unexpected delays, technical blockers, or shifting goals—daily meetings may be essential. If a complex issue becomes central to progress, the team may need to bring in domain experts or decision-makers temporarily, ensuring the right people are in the room to move things forward. The key is responsiveness: adjusting the cadence and attendance to fit the moment, not sticking rigidly to a schedule that no longer serves the project’s needs.
