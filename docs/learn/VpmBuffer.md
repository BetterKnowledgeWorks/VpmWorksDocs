# Buffer

## Buffer and incompressible deliverables
This is one of the counter-intuitive functions buffer—it tries to speed up everything.  It works well for most tasks, which can be sped up.  It works poorly for fixed schedule such as those with outside vendor contracts.  However, you will NEVER be responsible do deliver before the original (unbuffered) date.  As you’ll see while the project progresses, buffer will burn and the schedule date for your task get closer and closer to the unbuffered date.  In my experience, procurement tasks that are on time to the original schedule almost never burn buffer; and in the rare cases where they do, it’s not a problem.

The intent of the buffer is to force critical thinking—sometimes it helps shorten things and others it doesn’t (as with all critical thinking).  For procurement and customer meetings, this one of those places where we ask you to trust the system until you’ve been through a project once.  Almost every person in procurement voices your concerns—they are valid.  People with fixed meetings with customers do as well.  But you’ll see over time that they don’t have the effect you’re concerned about.
