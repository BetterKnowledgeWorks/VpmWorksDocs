# Visual Project Management for Single- and Multi-Phase Projects

In Visual Project Management (VPM), a project phase typically spans 3 to 6 months—long enough to achieve meaningful progress, yet short enough to maintain a strong sense of urgency where each week (and ideally each day) matters. VPM is designed to support both single- and multi-phase projects, though its primary use case is multi-phase initiatives. 

For **multi-phase**, a project is often divided into 4 to 6 phases aligned to the company's Phase-Gate (or Stage-Gate) system. Planning begins with a high-level view of the entire project, where tasks are generally 2 to 4 weeks long. The upcoming phase is then planned in detail, with tasks typically scoped to 3 to 7 days. During execution, the current phase becomes the team’s central focus—comparable to winning a game as part of a longer season.

Phases in a VPM project usually align with the organization’s established phase-gate model, but there are exceptions. If a phase is projected to last significantly longer than 6 months—such as a full year—the team may elect to divide it at a logical midpoint to restore urgency and manageability. Conversely, if phases are unusually short, two phase-gate stages may be combined into a single VPM execution phase.

**Single-phase projects** are those with an inherently short duration—typically 3 to 4 months—where dividing the work into multiple phases offers little added value. In such cases, the entire project is planned in detail from the start, with most tasks scoped to 3 to 7 days. These shorter efforts naturally carry enough urgency that progress is felt daily, eliminating the need to artificially segment the project into execution phases.

Later, we will introduce the fever chart—the team’s primary performance scoreboard. In VPM, fever charts are applied to each execution phase individually, unless the project is managed as a single phase, in which case the chart tracks the project as a whole.
