# Kanban for Managing Many Small Tasks

## Overview

**Kanban** is a visual workflow system built for teams managing **hundreds or thousands of small tasks** over the course of a year. Unlike traditional project management methods, which are optimized for large, structured initiatives, Kanban thrives in high-variability environments where tasks shift rapidly and priorities are constantly in flux.

## Key Concepts

### The Problems
- Most teams juggle **dozens of small demands** alongside major projects  
- Work comes from many directions: Sales, Ops, HR, IT, and others  
- Task scope often changes mid-stream  
- Priorities are unclear, creating conflict and overload  
- This leads to **unrationalized workload**, where no reasonable effort can meet expectations  

### The Solution: Three Core Shifts

1. **Just-in-Time Rationalization**  
   - Delay commitment until work is ready to begin  
   - Reduces rework caused by shifting priorities  

2. **Ruthless Rationalization**  
   - Never accept more work than the team can deliver  
   - Always negotiate scope, timing, or resources  

3. **Visual Flow Management**  
   - Use Kanban boards for visibility and flow control  
   - Enforce work-in-progress (WIP) limits to avoid overload

## Quick Start Checklist

- [ ] Identify your small-task workload  
- [ ] Set up a basic Kanban board (Backlog → Next Up → In Progress → Done)  
- [ ] Define WIP limits  
- [ ] Schedule weekly rationalization meetings  
- [ ] Add a simple performance dashboard  
- [ ] Launch a continuous improvement cycle

## Common Waste Patterns

Without rationalization, most organizations experience:

- **Work pile-ups** – Tasks accumulate with no clear path to completion  
- **Chronic pressure** – Teams feel perpetually behind  
- **Stakeholder dissatisfaction** – Customers and partners feel neglected  
- **Escalation spirals** – People push harder, not smarter
