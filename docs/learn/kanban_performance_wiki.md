# Performance Tracking

## The Performance Management Cycle

**Kanban creates a lean thinking laboratory** where changes install quickly and produce results (or fail) within weeks. This rapid feedback enables continuous improvement and team empowerment.

## Core Performance Principles

### The Lean Equation in Action
Over time, Kanban boards provide the clearest view of the interaction between:
- **Value** — What matters to customers and business
- **Effort** — Resources and time invested
- **Waste** — Activities that don't add value

### Rapid Experimentation Culture
- **Changes implement quickly** — Adjust board, see results in weeks
- **Low-risk environment** — Small task workflow vs. high-stakes projects
- **Team empowerment** — People feel free to do the right thing
- **Spontaneous problem-solving** — Teams naturally swarm on issues

## Performance Measurement Framework

### Flow Performance

#### Throughput Analysis
- **Tasks per week/month** — Basic velocity measurement
- **Throughput stability** — Consistency over time
- **Throughput by work type** — Different categories, different speeds
- **Seasonal patterns** — Understanding natural variation

#### Cycle Time Optimization
- **Average cycle time** — Start to finish duration
- **Cycle time distribution** — Understanding variation patterns
- **Bottleneck identification** — Where work slows down
- **Cycle time by complexity** — Different sizes, different timelines

#### Work in Progress Management
- **WIP limit adherence** — Following established constraints
- **WIP optimization** — Finding right limits for flow
- **Queue lengths** — Work waiting in each column
- **Flow efficiency** — Active time vs. waiting time

### Quality Performance

#### First-Time Quality
- **Defect rate** — Percentage requiring rework
- **Root cause analysis** — Why quality issues occur
- **Prevention measures** — Stopping problems before they start
- **Quality trends** — Improving or declining over time

#### Customer Satisfaction
- **Feedback scores** — Direct customer input
- **Response time** — Speed of addressing concerns
- **Resolution effectiveness** — Solving problems completely
- **Satisfaction trends** — Long-term relationship health

### Business Impact Performance

#### Value Delivery
- **Business value per task** — ROI measurement
- **Value delivery rate** — Business impact over time
- **Value by category** — Which work types deliver most impact
- **Cost-benefit analysis** — Investment vs. return

#### Strategic Alignment
- **Percentage strategic work** — Planned vs. tactical tasks
- **Goal achievement** — Meeting organizational objectives
- **Resource allocation** — Where capacity actually goes
- **Priority adherence** — Doing what we said we'd do

## Performance Improvement Techniques

### Flow Optimization

#### Identifying Bottlenecks
1. **Column analysis** — Where work accumulates
2. **Cycle time breakdown** — Which stages take longest
3. **Handoff analysis** — Where work gets stuck between stages
4. **Capacity mismatches** — Supply and demand imbalances

#### Bottleneck Resolution
- **Add capacity** — More people or resources
- **Improve skills** — Training and cross-training
- **Streamline process** — Remove unnecessary steps
- **Better prioritization** — Higher-value work first

#### WIP Limit Optimization
- **Start conservative** — Lower limits, increase gradually
- **Monitor flow** — Smooth movement vs. stopping/starting
- **Team feedback** — How limits feel to those doing work
- **Data-driven adjustment** — Use cycle time and throughput data

### Quality Improvement

#### Prevention Strategies
- **Definition of Done** — Clear completion criteria
- **Peer review** — Second set of eyes on work
- **Templates and checklists** — Standardized approaches
- **Skill development** — Training to prevent common errors

#### Detection Strategies  
- **Review stages** — Built into workflow
- **Customer feedback loops** — Early warning systems
- **Automated testing** — Where applicable
- **Quality metrics tracking** — Trend analysis

### Capacity Optimization

#### Understanding True Capacity
- **Available hours** — Time actually available for work
- **Utilization rate** — Productive vs. non-productive time
- **Skill mix** — Right people for right work
- **Capacity variation** — How capacity changes over time

#### Capacity Planning
- **Demand forecasting** — Predicting incoming work
- **Capacity matching** — Aligning resources with demand
- **Buffer management** — Handling uncertainty and variation
- **Cross-training programs** — Flexible skill deployment

## Performance Analytics

### Trend Analysis

#### Performance Trends to Track
- **Monthly throughput** — Capacity and improvement trends
- **Quality trends** — Defect rates and customer satisfaction
- **Cycle time trends** — Speed and predictability
- **Value delivery trends** — Business impact over time

#### Statistical Analysis
- **Moving averages** — Smoothing out noise to see trends  
- **Standard deviation** — Understanding variation
- **Control charts** — Identifying when system changes
- **Correlation analysis** — What factors drive performance

### Predictive Analytics

#### Forecasting Capabilities
- **Delivery date prediction** — When work will complete
- **Capacity planning** — Future resource needs
- **Bottleneck prediction** — Where problems will occur
- **Quality prediction** — Risk of defects or rework

#### Early Warning Systems
- **Performance degradation alerts** — When metrics decline
- **Bottleneck formation** — Before flow stops
- **Quality risk indicators** — Prevent defects
- **Capacity overload warnings** — Before team burns out

## Performance Communication

### Team Performance Reviews

#### Daily Performance Check
- **Flow status** — Are we moving work through?
- **Blocker identification** — What's stopping progress?
- **Quality concerns** — Any issues emerging?
- **Capacity alerts** — Overload or underutilization?

#### Weekly Performance Analysis
- **Throughput review** — What did we complete?
- **Cycle time analysis** — How fast are we working?
- **Quality assessment** — Customer satisfaction and defects
- **Improvement opportunities** — What can we optimize?

### Stakeholder Communication

#### Management Reporting
- **Business impact summary** — Value delivered
- **Performance trends** — Direction and improvement
- **Resource utilization** — Efficiency and effectiveness
- **Risk indicators** — What needs attention

#### Customer Communication
- **Service quality reports** — How we're performing for them
- **Delivery predictability** — Reliability of commitments
- **Improvement initiatives** — How we're getting better
- **Feedback integration** — How their input drives change

## Continuous Improvement Process

### Kaizen Culture Development

#### Team Empowerment
- **Authority to experiment** — Try process improvements
- **Safe-to-fail environment** — Learning from mistakes
- **Recognition of improvement** — Celebrating successes
- **Shared ownership** — Everyone responsible for performance

#### Improvement Methodology
1. **Identify opportunity** — Data-driven problem identification
2. **Hypothesize solution** — Theory of what will help
3. **Design experiment** — Small, measurable change
4. **Implement and measure** — Try it and track results
5. **Evaluate and decide** — Keep, modify, or abandon change
